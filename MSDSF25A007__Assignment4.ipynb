            "   Dynamic typing allows any variable to hold any type, but operations are type-specific. Without validation, you might try to call set methods on a list, causing AttributeError at runtime.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Improves Code Reliability:\n",
            "   Type checking acts as a guard clause, ensuring functions receive expected inputs. This prevents subtle bugs that might not surface immediately.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Enhances Debugging:\n",

            "4. Better Documentation:\n",
            "   Type checking serves as executable documentation, making function requirements explicit and helping other developers understand how to use your code.\n",

            "5. Maintains Data Integrity:\n",

            "6. Facilitates Refactoring:\n",
            "   With type validation, you can confidently refactor code knowing that type mismatches will be caught early rather than causing runtime failures.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Improves User Experience:\n",

            "🛡️  1. Prevents Program Crashes:\n",
            "   Without exception handling, an IndexError or TypeError would terminate the entire program. With proper handling, the program continues running and can recover gracefully.\n",
            "\n",
            "🛡️  2. Graceful Error Recovery:\n",
            "   Instead of crashing, the function returns a sensible default value (None or custom default) allowing the calling code to decide how to handle the situation.\n",
            "\n",
            "🛡️  3. User-Friendly Experience:\n",
